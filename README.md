# Ransomware Detection

This repository contains a Colab-based implementation for ransomware detection using machine learning techniques. The project aims to classify and detect potential ransomware based on various features extracted from system or network data.

## Project Overview

Ransomware is a type of malicious software that blocks access to a system or its data until a ransom is paid. The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting ransomware and preventing further damage.

This project involves:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training
- Performance evaluation

## Code Structure

The main code for this project is implemented in the `ransomware_detection.ipynb` Colab notebook.

### Key Components:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Data is loaded from a CSV file and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
2. **Feature Selection:** Key features for ransomware detection are selected based on domain knowledge and data analysis.
3. **Model Training:** Machine learning models are trained to detect ransomware, including algorithms like:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost
4. **Evaluation Metrics:** The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aadityaahire7/ransomware_detection.git
   ```

2. Open the Colab notebook `ransomware_detection.ipynb` in Google Colab.

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Load the data
   - Preprocess the features
   - Train the machine learning models
   - Evaluate the results

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed in your Colab environment:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`
- `matplotlib`

These can be installed using the following commands:
```bash
!pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains features related to system activity and network traffic. It is not included in this repository, but you can upload your dataset to Colab when prompted in the notebook.

## Results

The trained models achieved the following results:
- **Accuracy:** 90+% on the test dataset
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score:** Depending on the model and parameters used.
